# Image Based Lightning
 I did this little project to create and experiment with post-processing effects.
 
## How to run ?

Simply clone the repository and then run the ibl.exe file.

## How to see my work ?

My work is in the third tab named "Post-process" of the program. To see the source files, go to src and click on which file you want to inspect or simply launch the Visual Studio solution located in the root directory. But for the second part, you'll need to have Visual Studio 2019 installed on your device.
